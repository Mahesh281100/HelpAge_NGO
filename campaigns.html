					<h2>Mobile Healthcare</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							In a country where more than 90% elders have to work in order to survive, affording quality medical care is a far dream. People are living longer, the Oldest Old, those 80 plus, are estimated to reach 53 million by 2050. 88% of the Oldest Old (80+) suffer from chronic ailments such as hypertension, asthma, arthritis, heart problems etc. HelpAge’s Mobile Healthcare program seeks to provide sustainable healthcare solutions to destitute elders and their community where these are none available through its Mobile Healthcare Units (MHUs). Each MHU has a doctor, pharmacist and a social worker. These MHUs go into the interiors of urban slums and villages, bringing healthcare virtually at the doorsteps of these destitute elders. For most elders it saves them from the long lines at hospitals which are also situated far from their communities and they get free medication on a monthly basis. Their Individual patient card keeps a record of their treatment and helps monitor their progress.

					<h2>Cataract Surgeries</h2>
					<p>
						<img src="images/catract-surgeries.jpg" width="250px"><img src="images/catract-surgeries (1).jpg" width="245px">Cataract is one the major causes of blindness in India. 12.5 million people are blind & cannot afford treatment. HelpAge conducts more than 35,000 cataract eye surgeries in 15 states. Credible and competent eye hospitals and organizations carry out surgeries with HelpAge India’s support. All surgeries under the program are performed only in base hospitals and not in make-shift camps. Since 1980, this program has benefitted more than 9 lakh elders, not just restoring their sight but enabling them to go back to work and live a life of dignity.

					<h2>Old Age Homes</h2>
					<p>
						<img src="images/home.jpg" width="215px"><br>A roof over their heads is a critical need of the elder who are destitute, sick and abandoned by family and those uprooted by disasters. HelpAge India has established model homes for the senior citizens and aged in places such as Patiala & Gurdaspur in Punjab, Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu and Kolkata in West Bengal. HelpAge supports 300 old age homes and runs 5 barrier homes for the aged in India.Keeping in mind the vulnerability of elders & our Corona warriors on ground, in the current Covid 19 pandemic situation, HelpAge India is adhering to all the safety and hygiene measures for all its programs on the field, like wearing face masks, regular washing & sanitization of hands, and maintaining social distancing norms at all times, to ensure their safety & protection.
